# DSC180
Helpers contatins python files of helper code written to make experimentation faster
Most exploring is done in 1-3_NAME.ipynb.

Unfortunately, github cannot hold the weights of the final model, as the file is too large. 

In order to run:
Must be run with a GPU!
python run.py [test or train]

Train will go through the training process of the four omodels utilized in the paper.
Test will run all statistics on models used on paper and regenerate figures.
